1. IDs & Classes are important because they are the identifications of HTML elements. Good IDs and Classes names could make it easier to access HTML elements in CSS files and JavaScript files and could make the code easier to read and maintain in the future.

2. Data attributes are meant for storing custom data for your page. Data Attributes are useful because they can be accessed through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To access data attributes, data-* can be used in HTML, getAttribute() can be used in JavaScript, and the attr() function can be used in CSS. Microdata in HTML is used for nesting metadata in sites. It's connected to attributes in that microdata has global attributes that can be used in HTML.

3. Dom fragment is an interface that represents a minimal document object. Also, the document fragment is not part of the active tree structure, so the changes made to the fragment will not affect the document. They are powerful because it allows us to easily append new elements to the fragment first and then attach the fragment to the DOM, which will eliminate numerous page refreshes and saves time.

4. Virtual Dom does comparison with the Browser Dom before changes are made, helping to find out what needs to be updated.With a virtual Dom you gain simplicity and speed. But, you lose out on memory efficiency as it uses lots of memory.

5. Because class attribute (className) is not considered an object property, it is rather the identification of the object and so cannot be accessed with a dot selector.

6. addEventListener() can add more than 1 event to a single element. onClick() can add only one event to an element. addEventListener is better() is to have multiple events to handle for an element. If you want a quick way to listen for an event, onClick() is sufficient. The disadvantage is that both require more memory usage in the application.
